# ResNet18

CIFER-10:
The code is ready to test and play with. The evaluation is going to be in growing intervals. so if there is a need to see it in more detail change the area starting at line 150.
Also Take a look if you need the checkpoints safed as well as the results in a seperate text file.


CIFER-10-C:

In order to work with the code you will need the checkpoints of a trained ResNet. It is not used to train the resNet on the CIFAR-10-C dataset but just for evaluation.
Also the CIFAR-10-C dataset needs to be downloaded and unpacked manually. You can find it Here: https://zenodo.org/record/2535967
